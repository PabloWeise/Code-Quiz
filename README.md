The "main" page, that contains the "start" button which starts the quiz. Once the button is clicked a question appears with four different options as buttons.

The "results" page, displayed when the quiz is over, displays "Game over", "the score"  and a label to input the users info.

The "High scores" page, that gives the user back info stored in local storage.

Basic css elements styling the headeer, background, rows and colums. Contains bootstrap elements

Event listeners for the buttons. To start the quiz, change questios/answers , subbmit inffo and re-start the quiz.
